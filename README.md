# Arc Animation with React

This is a simple arc animation using React, where a ball moves along a cubic Bézier curve between three points. The points are labeled A, B, and C, with clickable labels that trigger the ball's movement.

## Features

- Smooth animation along a cubic Bézier curve.
- Three static red points representing the start, middle, and end of the arc.
- A blue ball that animates along the path when clicking on the labels (A, B, C).
- Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes.

## Demo

The animation moves a ball along an arc between three points: A, B, and C. You can click on the labels to move the ball to the corresponding point.
